Enhanced version of Heretic 1.3, the classic Doom-based first person
shooter by Raven Software.


ABOUT THIS VERSION
------------------
This is not a beta version but that doesn't mean you couldn't run into
problems and odd things. See the end of this file for a list of known bugs
and other issues, with tips of how to get around them if possible. You
shouldn't encounter any crashing bugs, though (at least not in single-
player games). There are quite likely a couple of bugs in the multiplayer
code. I will keep improving it whenever I can...

------------
- Windows 95/98 (at least; should work under WinME/Win2k and NT, too)
- Hardware accelerated OpenGL or Direct3D (minimum: Voodoo 1 or similar)
- DirectX 6 or newer (newest one available is recommended)
- Registered or shareware Heretic (preferably v1.3)


FEATURES
--------
- works with both the shareware and registered Heretic
- mouse look
- enhanced menus
    * keyboard, mouse and joystick configuration
    * graphics options
    * sound and music options
    * multiplayer menu for network games

TIPS
----
- Type 'help' in the console. 'listcmds' and 'listvars' will show you a
  list of the console commands and variables, respectively.

- Load external WADs and lump files using the console, see the commands
  'load', 'unload' and 'reset'.

- Screenshots can be taken with the console command 'screenshot'. You could
  for example bind it to F12: 'bind f12 screenshot'.

- You can bind several keys or buttons to the same control/action in the
  Controls menu. Rebind a key or button to remove a binding. Nothing can be
  bound to the Esc key, which is used for menu activation.

- By default, the desktop color depth is used in the game.

- The current implementation of the dynamic lights is a bit slow when there
  are a lot of luminous objects to draw. The console variable 'dynlights'
  controls the rendering of the dynamic lights. Just set it to zero if
  things slow down too much. You can also use 'maxdl' to set the maximum
  number of dynamic lights. Notice that if you're using lens flares, many
  of the dynamic light calculations must still be done...


KNOWN BUGS & OTHER ISSUES
-------------------------
- The D3D renderer doesn't yet support display mode changes, so when using
  D3D you'll have to restart the game if you want to change the resolution.

- Due to inaccuracies in the original map data, it is possible to encounter
  quite large holes in the walls, floors and ceilings. Use glBSP to get rid
  of them (http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/).

- Sprites are two-dimensional so they look flat when viewed from up or down
  at a steep angle. If this is too distracting, try setting 'spralign' to
  one or two or use the Graphics Effects menu to change the sprite
  alignment. Also see the r_maxSpriteAngle cvar.
