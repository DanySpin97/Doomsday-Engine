/**
 * Implements high level logic for the manipulation and configuration of the logical game session.
 *
 * The game session (singleton) exists at the same conceptual level as the logical game state and
 * the associated action (stack). The primary job of this component is to ensure that the current
 * game state remains valid and to provide a mechanism for saving player progress.
 *
 * An internal backing store is used to record player progress automatically, whenever the current
 * map changes while the session is in progress. This occurs irrespective of the user's savegame
 * preferences. Additionally, the user may configure the game so that the internal backing store
 * is periodically (e.g., when the map changes) copied to a new "autosave" automatically.
 *
 * The "scope" of a continous game session progression depends on the configuration of the World
 * and the Maps within it. Upon leaving one map and entering another, if both are attributed to
 * the same logical "hub" then the current state of the map is written to the backing store so
 * that it may be reloaded later if the player(s) decide to revisit. However, if the new map is
 * in another hub, or no hub is defined, then all saved map progress for current hub is discarded.
 *
 * Note that the use of hubs is not required and some games may not use them at all (e.g., DOOM).
