====================================================================
NOTE: You no longer need kick.exe to start the game.

1: will there be an mp3 music wad?

1A: Of course! The wad should be on the same page/link where the tc is posted.

2: does the motherdemon work right?

2A: Yes, and her attack has been enhanced to challenge the more experienced Doomers.

3: what new stuff that wasn't in the real game be in the tc?

3A: Can't say...

4: Why do I get a memory allocation errror?

4A: Your memory is set too low. Try using maxzone192.bat

5: All the sprites are in low resolution. Why?

5A: The hi res sprites are stored in pk3 files, which goes in /data/doom64/auto/. From there, they are loaded automatically.

6: Why can't I turn jumping on?

6A: Complete Map38

7: When I pick up the Unmaker, the game crashes, why?

7A: Doom64 TC uses a new DLL file called Doom64.dll, this file contains new coded information for the TC which belongs in /bin.

8: Can I play the TC on another port beises Jdoom, or on Doomsday?

8A: No, its made for the Absolution game only.

9: Is this an addon wad for Doom2?

9A: No, this is a entire new game on its own, but due to legal reasons etc, you must have a registered copy of Doom2 to play. So you must have the doom2.wad to play this game.

10: I can't mouselook!

10A: Go to console (~) and type input-mouse-y-disable 0

11: How come some of the particle effects are missing?

11A: I took them out of the rocket smoke trail and explosion effects to simply display the new rocket trail sprite and new fade away/hi res rocket explosion.

12: Why isn't this TC perfect?

12A: Because me and the rest of the team tried our best to make this close as possible to the real thing, right now I am VERY pleased that we were able to get 90% of the game converted, and thank Skyjake for this wonderful source port that made this TC possible.

13: I am getting errors launching the game.

13a: This TC uses direct x renderings as its default renderer because of unknown gliches opengl causes to some of the glowing effects. Download the latest direct x installer. If that doesn't work, then launch opengl.bat.

14: Where does the Doom2 IWAD go?

14a: /bin/

15: Can I play this online?

15a: No all levels were designed for sp only.
