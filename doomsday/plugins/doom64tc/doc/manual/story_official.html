<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Your fatigue
was enormous, the price for encountering pure evil. Hell was a place no
mortal was meant to experience. Stupid military doctors: their tests and
treatments, were of little help. In the end, what did matter - it was classified
and sealed. The nightmares continued. Demons, So many Demons; relentless,
pouring through</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>Far Away...</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>The planetary
policy was clear. An absolute quarantine was guaranteed by apocalyptic
levels of radiation. The empty dark corridors stand motionless, abandoned.
The installations sealed.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>The Present</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>A long forgotten
relay satellite barely executing, decayed by years of bombarding neutrons,
activated and sends its final message to Earth. The satellite's message
was horrific, from the planetary void there came energy signatures unlike
anything sampled before.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>The classified
archives are opened. The military episodes code named "DOOM" were not actually
complete. A single entity with vast rejuvenation powers, masked by extreme
radiation levels, escaped detection. In it's crippled state, it systematically
altered decaying dead carnage back into corrupted living tissue.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>The mutations
are devastating. The Demons have returned even stronger and more vicious
than before. As the only experienced survivor of the DOOM episode, your
commission is re-activated. You assignment is clear: MERCILESS EXTERMINATION.</font></font></font></td>
