64 environment</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Doors and switches</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">To open most doors and operate
swites, stand directly in front of them and press the Use button. When
you successfully operate a switch, it will change in some way (lights up,
flips a handle, etc).</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">If a switch does not change
after a coupole of tries, it is probably assigned to a task that has yet
to be accomplished, you already operated it, or it is not a switch. You'll
have toe xperiment. Some switches activate something out-of-view. Listen
closely, and use your automap to find it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Hidden Doors</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some doors are hidden. Many
of these can be opened by finding a switch. In some cases you just need
to walk up to the wall and press Use button. Some are operated by special
tripwires or proximity detectors. If you've found a secret door, it will
often contain some much needed items, or prehaps something special.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">There are clues that reveal
a secret door (Different colored lighting on the wall, a wall that is shifted
down, a flickering light on the wall, etc). Look closely. Demons don't
care about interior design.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Locked Doors</font></font></font>
<br><img SRC="locked.jpg" height=240 width=320>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some doors and switches
have security locks and require you to have a colorcoded (red, yellow,
or blue) security card or skull key to open them. Other locked doors are
operated by a nearby switch. Rather than walking up to the door, you'll
need to operate the switch. Beware, picking up a key sometimes get the
attention of many monsters.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Platforms &amp;
Elevators</font></font></font>
<br><img SRC="plat.jpg" height=240 width=320>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Often, you'll see platforms
that raise and lower. Some platforms operate continuously, while others
must be activated. Some of them are proximity activate, while other have
a nearby switch. Those without a switch can sometimes be operated by walking
up to the platform and pressing the Use button.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Teleporters</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">As the Demons mutate their
surrounding environment, they installed Teleporters for instant transporation.
To use a teleporter, just walk over the field to activate it.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Dangerous Hazards</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some parts of the environment
can more dangerous than the monsters you'll face. Areas containing radioactive
waste or crushing ceilings should be approached with caution.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>Slime &amp;
Other Radioactive Waste</font></font></font>
<br><img SRC="hazzard.jpg" height=240 width=320>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Many of the areas contain
pools of dangerous liquis that will damage you if you walk through them.
There are several varieties of waste, each doing variable amounts of damage.
Loof for radioactive protection and other objects that may help you. If
it looks fluid, beware!</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>Crushing Ceilings</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Some ceilnigs can smash
you, making you cry blood. Often, you'll be able to see the ceiling moving
before you go under, but not always. Be careful, this is no slide on ice!</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>Barrels</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Drums containing fuel and
other violatile substances can be found scatter about. If fired at, barrels
creating a body blasting explosion. Fire at these near enemies and watch
them go BOOM! Be careful thought, don't get too close tot he blast because
it could take YOU out too.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Completing
an Area</font></font></font>
<br><img SRC="exit.jpg" height=240 width=320>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Within each level, there
is an Exit area marked by an "EXIT" sign.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">When you exit a level, an
Achievement Screen tallies your performance - ratio of kills, percentage
of items collected, amount of secrets found, and your completion time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FF9900"><font size=+2>Eternal Life
after Death</font></font></font>
<br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">If you die(By the way, better
luck next time!), you restart he level at the beginning with just your
pistol and 50 bullets. It's a shame to lose all the weaponry you've collected,
but you can't take that stuff with you when you die. That's just the way
it works.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Monsters you you killed before
are back again, just like you. Yeah, sucks, doesn't it?</font></font></center>
