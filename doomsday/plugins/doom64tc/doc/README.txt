		DooM 64: Outcast - Information
============================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------
How to install:
----------------------------------------------------------
-To insure proper functionality, download the latest version of the Doom64 TC located at http://doomdepot.doom2.net/. If site is down, please contact me.
-Copy and paste the "bin" folder over the current "bin" folder that is in your doom64 TC directory. Make sure you overwrite all existing files when prompt.
-Launch the absolution.exe and after choosing the difficulty setting, choose "The Outcast Levels". The game will begin at level 40.
----------------------------------------------------------
Description:
----------------------------------------------------------
Doom64 Outcast is a expansion pack for the Doom64 TC, but due to lack of intrest, the addon has been cancelled and only 7 out of 10 maps where completed. Outcast features new enemies, improved code, and more textures. Also included with Outcast is another 8 level add on by Steven Searle and AgentSpork called Redemption Denied. This addon can be used as an option. Since Outcast is unfinished, there will be
many errors and bugs.
----------------------------------------------------------
Using HellTime and Levitation for the Unmaker:
----------------------------------------------------------
As you progress in Outcast, you will come across two new powerups for your unmaker called
HellTime and Levitation. When you pick these up, an icon of these powerups will appear in
your far left side of the hud. To use them, you must switch your unmaker though different
modes. To switch modes, press the unmaker key (default is 'u') while you are holding the
unmaker. The unmaker will begin to flash either red (helltime) or green (levitation). HellTime
gives you the power to slow down time allowing you to dodge fast projectiles while the
levitation powerup spawns floating platforms for you to ride.
----------------------------------------------------------
Reason why it was abandoned:
----------------------------------------------------------
Simple, I hated the engine. Doomsday was perfect for the Doom64 TC, but it wasn't perfect
for custom Doom64 TC levels, and thats where Outcast failed. Even with the Doom64 TC itself
I still couldn't achieve what I wanted and there were so many things that I just couldn't do.
The reason for the stand alone exe was to avoid having to update the TC alongside with
Jdoom. There will too many issues going on and I didn't want to update the TC for useless
features just so it can be runned on Jdoom/Doomsday. So I made it a stand alone. 
Outcast and the Doom64 TC will be re-worked on someday once I get the new engine in
gear, but I am not certain when this will happen.
----------------------------------------------------------
Support:
----------------------------------------------------------
Outcast MUST BE USED with the Doom64 TC. Do NOT run this with Doomsday. Also I will not
support Doom64 TC/Outcast editing. The TC isn't meant for custom levels.
----------------------------------------------------------
Story:
----------------------------------------------------------
You blasted your way though UAC and Hell to end the invasion led by the Motherdemon and at last you won.
You remained hell to insure that no demon will ever rise again. But you had enough and decided to return home.
You sent a transmission call to UAC...nothing.. you are now stuck in Hell. Seven years have passed and you have
gone mad. UAC never have bothered to use their portals to find you. You have now been forgotten, no one knows
about your effort to save the world from hell, no one knows about your war anymore. UAC have re-contructed their
headquaters on Mars were they continue their research. Times have passed as you remained isolated and kept
from human existance. Luckily you found a portal and you return to return to whats left of the Phobos complex,
only to find the remaining demons nesting.
Craving for your killing instinct, you begin your killing frenzy on the remaining demons. This isn't for UAC, or Earth anymore,
this is all for you. These will be your last days alive as you no longer have the will to live anymore.
