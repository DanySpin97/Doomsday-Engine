BETA RELEASE
This is a non-optimized debug build. Single player games should work
flawlessly but there are still some things that are wrong with network
games. On the whole multiplayer games should at least be stable.
No 3D models have been included.

Since this is a beta version, I'd appreciate hearing how it works for 
you. If you encounter any bugs, please send me an email with the 
contents of Doomsday.out included. (NOTE: When an error message is 
shown and the game exits to Windows, Notepad opens up automatically 
showing Doomsday.out. However, that does NOT happen if the game 
actually *crashes*.)

To play, run Kicks.exe.

(If you get error messages about missing DLLs or OCXs, please download
the file vbsupp.exe from http://jhexen.raven-games.com/. Doomsday 
KickStart is a Visual Basic application and thus requires a couple of
support libraries.)
