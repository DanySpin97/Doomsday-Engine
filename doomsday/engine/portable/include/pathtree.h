     * PathTree. Data structure for modelling a hierarchical relationship tree of
     * string + data value pairs.
     *
     * 'fragment' is the term given to a name in a hierarchical path. For example,
     * the path <pre>"c:/somewhere/something"</pre> contains three path fragments:
     * <pre>[ 0: "c:", 1: "somewhere", 2: "something" ]</pre>
     *
     * 'delimiter' is the term given to the separators between fragments. (Such as
     * forward slashes in a file path).
     *
     * Internally, fragments are "pooled" such that only one instance of a fragment
     * is included in the model of the whole tree. Potentially, this significantly
     * reduces the memory overhead which would otherwise be necessary to represent
     * the complete hierarchy as a set of fully composed paths.
     *
     * Delimiters are not included in the hierarchy model. Not including the delimiters
     * allows for optimal dynamic replacement when recomposing the original paths
     * (also reducing the memory overhead for the whole data set). One potential use
     * for this feature when representing file path hierarchies is "ambidextrously"
     * recomposing paths with either forward or backward slashes, irrespective of
     * the delimiter used at path insertion time.
