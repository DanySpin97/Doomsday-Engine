/**
 * Virtual file system and file (input) stream abstraction layer.
 *
 * This version supports runtime (un)loading.
 *
 * File input. Can read from real files or WAD lumps. Note that
 * reading from WAD lumps means that a copy is taken of the lump when
 * the corresponding 'file' is opened. With big files this uses
 * considerable memory and time.
 *
 * Internally, the cache has two parts: the Primary cache, which is loaded
 * from data files, and the Auxiliary cache, which is generated at runtime.
 * To outsiders, there is no difference between these two caches. The
 * only visible difference is that lumps in the auxiliary cache use indices
 * starting from AUXILIARY_BASE.
 *
 * Functions that don't know the lumpnum of file will have to check both
 * the primary and the auxiliary caches (e.g., F_CheckLumpNumForName()).
