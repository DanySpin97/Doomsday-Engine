/**
 * @file rend_fakeradio.h Faked Radiosity Lighting
 *
 * Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of radiosity lighting
 * is that the corners of a room are slightly dimmer than the rest of
 * the surfaces.  (It's not the only characteristic, however.)  We
 * will fake these shadowed areas by generating shadow polygons for
 * wall segments and determining, which BSP leaf vertices will be
 * shadowed.
 *
 * In other words, walls use shadow polygons (over entire hedges), while
 * planes use vertex lighting.  Since planes are usually tesselated
 * into a great deal of BSP leafs (and triangles), they are better
 * suited for vertex lighting.  In some cases we will be forced to
 * split a BSP leaf into smaller pieces than strictly necessary in
 * order to achieve better accuracy in the shadow effect.
