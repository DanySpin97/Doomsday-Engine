AMETHYST CHANGELOG
==================

1.1.1 (Jan 2012)
----------------
+ If macro "CR_NL" defined, \n is output as \r\n.
+ Left-to-right mathematic expressions in rules: @v(3+5*2) => 16.
+ Global variable "x" can be used to store values: @v(12=x).
- Gem class filter only applies for the 'normal' part, not pre/post.
- Rule markers (@<, @>, @[, etc.) always end at the next marker.

1.1.0 (Apr 2011)
----------------
+ Unicode (UTF-8) support for input and output files.
+ @else after @ifdef/@ifndef.
+ Added the ^ modifier (escalation) for gem tests.
+ Anchors (@&), inserting text at the anchor with @[, @] filters.
+ Added format selectors for flush modes (left, right, center).
+ Unix: installing with "make install" under PREFIX (default: /usr/local).
+ Added a post-line-breaking flag for commands.
- Context flow in unfilled output did not advance correctly.
- @center{} now breaks the line before and after.
- @apply{@D}{spec} uses the format 'spec' to produce a timestamp.
  See QDateTime::toString(QString format) in the Qt reference.
- Flush modes are inherited correctly in the gem tree.
* Ported to Qt.
* Refactored according to better coding conventions.
* Changed license to GPL v3.
* Apply pre and post filters in the Contents.

1.0.1 (Sep 4, 2002)
-------------------
- Corrected macro calls. Previously it was impossible to use @arg in 
  a nested macro call, because the original caller wasn't properly kept
  track of. Now a call stack keeps track of the call hierarchy.

1.0.0 (July 30, 2002)
---------------------
+ Initial version.
