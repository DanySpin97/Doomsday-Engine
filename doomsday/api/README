DOOMSDAY CLIENT/SERVER PUBLIC API
=================================

This folder contains header files for the Doomsday Client and Server public
APIs: this is all the functionality made available by the executables at
runtime. Plugins need to use these APIs for registering hooks and accessing
the engine's runtime functionality.
