Your runtime files (savegames, screenshots) are stored into a folder called
@file{~/Library/Application Support/Doomsday Engine/runtime}.

To see the Doomsday startup messages, either find @file{doomsday.out} in the
runtime folder, or view @file{console.log} in @strong{Console.app}. The
startup messages will appear in @file{console.log} while Doomsday is being
loaded.
