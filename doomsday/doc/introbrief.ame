The Doomsday Engine is an enhanced Doom source port for the Windows, Mac OS X,
and Linux platforms. It is based on the source code of id Software's Doom and
Raven Software's Heretic and Hexen. The Doomsday Engine and the associated
ports of Doom, Heretic and Hexen have been under development since 1999; the
first versions were released in late 1999 and early 2000. Several people have
been involved in the project (see @ref{acks}{Acknowledgements}).

The purpose of the project is to create versions of Doom, Heretic and Hexen
that feel the same as the original games but take advantage of modern
techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server networking. A lot of emphasis
is placed on good-looking graphics.
