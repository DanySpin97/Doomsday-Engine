                    Doomsday Command Line Options
                    =============================


OPTION          ABBR.   DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
@(filename)             Response file. The given file is read and its
                        contents are inserted to the command line,
                        replacing the option itself. E.g. "@args.rsp"

--                      Stop processing options. Anything after this is
                        discarded.

-fullstart              Start in fullscreen mode. Using this option may be
                        required if your video card does not support
                        rendering into a window. If this option is not
                        used, Doomsday will start in windowed mode and then
                        switch to fullscreen when necessary.

-dedicated              Run in dedicated mode. No graphics or sounds will
                        be initialized. The game will run in a text mode
                        console.

-server                 Start running in server mode right after startup,
                        using TCP/IP as the network protocol.

-connect IP             Connect to a server running at the specified IP
                        address immediately after startup, using TCP/IP.
                        For example: "-connect 127.0.0.1". The port to use
                        can be included: "-connect 127.0.0.1:12345".

-game F         -g      Specifies the game DLL to use (required). This must
                        either be just the file name (jDoom.dll) or the
                        full path to the DLL (C:\Doomsday\Bin\jDoom.dll).

-gl F           -r      Specifies the rendering DLL to use (drOpenGL.dll by
                        default). This must either be just the file name
                        (drD3D.dll) or the full path to the DLL
                        (C:\Doomsday\Bin\drD3D.dll).

-def F                  Additional Doomsday Engine Definition files to
                        read. The given files are read in addition to the
                        default DED files.

-defs F         -d      Specifies the Doomsday Engine Definition files to
                        read. You can give more than one DED file as the
                        parameter. When using this option you must give the
                        name of the primary DED file first (for example
                        jDoom.ded).

-config F       -cfg    Specifies the .CFG file to use (for example
                        jDoom.cfg). When the game is quit, console variable
                        values and key bindings are written to this file.

-file F         -f      Loads in the given WAD file as a startup WAD (i.e.
                        it can't be unloaded with the "unload" command).
                        You can give more than one WAD file as the
                        parameter. An alternative to -file is -iwad, which
                        works in the same way.

-command S      -cmd    After initialization executes the console command
                        S. Note that if the command includes whitespace
                        characters it must be quoted. E.g. to execute the
                        command:

                          echo "Hello world."

                        you must use the option:

                          -command "echo ""Hello world."""

                        More than one command can be given as a parameter,
                        either as separate command line options (-cmd S S
                        S) or separate console commands (-cmd "S; S; S").

-parse F        -p      After initialization reads the given file and
                        executes the commands in it (by treating each read
                        line as a console command). You can give more than
                        one file as the parameter.

-cparse F       -cp     Same as -parse, but executes the commands before
                        anything is initialized (right after console
                        variable values have been read from the default
                        config file). You can give more than one file as
                        the parameter.

-maxzone N      -mem    Specify how much memory will be allocated for the
                        game (N bytes). E.g. to allocate 32 Mbs
                        "-maxzone 32m"

-sfxchan N              Set the number of sound channels. 16 is the
                        default.

-eaxignore              Ignore any errors that occur with EAX.

-bpp N          -b      Specify the color depth to use. Defaults to
                        desktop color depth. E.g. "-bpp 32"

-window         -wnd    Start the game in a window. By default the game
                        runs in fullscreen mode.

-width N        -w      Game window width or display resolution X. The
                        default value for this is taken from the "defResX"
                        console variable.

-height N       -h      Game window height or display resolution Y. The
                        default value for this is taken from the "defResY"
                        console variable.

-winsize N N    -wh     Game window width and height or display resolution.

-nocenter       -noc    Prevents the game window from being centered on
                        screen.

-paltex         -ptx    Use paletted textures (if supported by the
                        hardware).

-modeldir P     -md     Uses the given search path instead of the one
                        specified in the primary DED file.

-renorm                 Recalculates the surface normals of all MD2 models
                        when the models are loaded.

-bigmtex                If a masked texture has taller patches than the
                        texture's height, the engine will resize the
                        texture so that the largest patch will fit.

-outlines               All letters, sprites, etc. will have black
                        outlines.

-playdemo F             After initialization loads the given demo file F
                        (which resides in the Demo subdirectory), plays it
                        and then quits.

-timedemo F             After initialization loads the given demo file F
                        (which resides in the Demo subdirectory), plays it
                        in singletics mode (i.e. as fast as possible),
                        displays frame count information and quits.

-dump S                 Writes the specified lump (S) into a file named
                        (S).DUM and quits.

-dumpfont               When a font is prepared it is written to a file
                        named FONT(id number).DFN.

-dumpwaddir             Prints the names of all the lumps in the loaded WAD
                        files and quits.

-out F                  Redirects output to the given file. By default all
                        messages are printed to Doomsday.out.

-nowsk                  Disable Windows system keys (Alt-Tab etc).

-nopitch                Disable sound effect pitch/frequence changes.

-nodop                  Disable doppler effect (with 3D sounds).

-nosound                Don't initialize sound or music.

-nomixer                Don't use Windows' mixer (used for CD volume).

-nosfx                  Don't initialize sound.

-nomusic                Don't initialize music.

-nofmod                 Don't initialize FMOD (http://fmod.org).

-nojoy                  Don't initialize joystick.

-nohightex              Disable high-resolution (PNG,TGA,PCX) textures.

-texdir P       -td     Loads all high-resolution (PNG,TGA,PCX) textures
                        from the given directory P. Defaults to
                        "Data\<Game>\Textures".

-texdir2 P      -td2    Secondary high-resolution (PNG,TGA,PCX) texture
                        directory. Defaults to "". This directory is
                        checked first, so it can be used to override
                        textures in the normal texture directory (-texdir).

-fontdir P      -fd     Looks in the given directory P for the font files.
                        Defaults to "Data\Fonts\".

-gdifonts               Use Windows' GDI fonts instead of the DFNs.

-userdir P      -ud     Sets the working directory. By default the engine
                        uses the current working directory (the one in
                        which it was started). Relative paths in -game and
                        -gl are not affected.

-basedir P      -bd     Defines a custom base directory that will be
                        prepended to some relative paths (default Fonts
                        path, model search paths, default DED file paths,
                        default WAD file paths). E.g. the standard
                        distribution uses "-basedir ..\..", which is the
                        relative path from the runtime folders to the
                        Doomsday root folder.

-stdbasedir     -sbd    Use the standard base directory ("..\..").

-sounddebug             Debug: Display lots of sound debug information.

-verbose                Be more verbose with console messages.

-dump_pal18to8          Generates a PAL18TO8 palette conversion table. If
                        you don't know what that means you don't have to
                        worry about this option.

-maxor N                Set the maximum number of occlusion ranges.
                        Increase the number when you get an error message
                        "Out of oranges (max N)."

===========================================================================
Dehacked Reader (dpDehRead.dll)

OPTION          ABBR.   DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-deh F                  Applies the Dehacked patch F. You can give more
                        than one F as arguments, e.g. "-deh first.deh
                        second.deh".

-alldehs                Allows the processing of more than one DEHACKED
                        lump. Otherwise only the DEHACKED lump that has
                        been loaded last is processed. Does not affect the
                        -deh option.

===========================================================================
OpenGL Renderer (drOpenGL.dll)

OPTION          ABBR.   DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-xpos N                 Game window X coordinate.

-ypos N                 Game window Y coordinate.

-texcomp                Use texture compression (if supported by the OpenGL
                        driver).

-allowsoftware          Allow using the software renderer if no 3D hardware
                        acceleration is detected (or reported by Windows).

-dumptextures           Debug: Writes Targa images out of all the textures
                        that are loaded (mipmap level zero).

===========================================================================
Direct3D Renderer (drD3D.dll)

OPTION          ABBR.   DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-d3dcfg                 Display the Direct3D configuration dialog. The
                        dialog is otherwise only shown if Ctrl, Shift or
                        Alt is held down when the game is started.

-texbits N              Set texture bit depth. Won't affect the default
                        configuration in drD3D.INI.

-zbits N                Set Z buffer bit depth. Won't affect the default
                        configuration in drD3D.INI.

-driver S               If possible, use the DirectDraw driver whose name
                        includes the string S.

-badtexalpha            Use as few bytes for texture alpha data as possible
                        (with 16 bit textures causes that only one bit is
                        used for the alpha data).

-nodither               Disable dithering.
