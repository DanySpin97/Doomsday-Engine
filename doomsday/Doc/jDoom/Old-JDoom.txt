JDOOM RELEASE NOTES
Version 1.01
August 19, 2001

    JDoom and the Doomsday Engine are based on the source code of various
    games released by id Software and Raven Software. You are free to
    distribute the installation archives of JDoom but you cannot charge
    money for them.

    This is the first official non-beta version. I'm hoping the worst bugs
    have been fixed and that the game is now quite stable. See the end of

TIPS

    - Type 'help' in the console. 'listcmds' and 'listvars' will show you a
      list of the console commands and variables, respectively.

    - Load external WADs and lump files using the console, see the commands
      'load', 'unload' and 'reset'.

    - Screenshots can be taken with the console command 'screenshot'. You
      could for example bind it to F12: 'bind f12 screenshot'.

    - You can bind several keys or buttons to the same control/action in
      the Controls menu. Nothing can be bound to the Esc key, which is used
      for menu activation.

    - By default, the desktop color depth is used in the game.

    - The current implementation of the dynamic lights might be a bit slow
      when there are a lot of luminous objects to draw. The console
      variable 'dynlights' controls the rendering of the dynamic lights.
      Just set it to zero if things slow down too much. You can also use
      'maxdl' to set the maximum number of dynamic lights. Notice that if
      you're using lens flares, many of the dynamic light calculations must
      still be done...


ISSUES

    - Due to inaccuracies in the original map data, it is possible to
      encounter quite large holes in the walls, floors and ceilings. It is
      *strongly recommended* that you use glBSP to get rid of them
      (http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/).

    - Run servers with a high framerate so clients will have smoother
      gameplay (this is a single-threaded application, during rendering
      everything else is stopped).

    - The D3D renderer doesn't support display mode changes, so you'll have
      to restart the game if you want to change the resolution when using
      it.

    - Sprites are two-dimensional so they look flat when viewed from up or
      down at a steep angle. If this is too distracting, try setting
      'spralign' to 1, 2 or 3 or use the Graphics Effects menu to change
      the sprite alignment. Also see the r_maxSpriteAngle cvar.
