JHexen 0.99.6
==============
by Jaakko Keränen

Enhanced version of Hexen 1.1, the classic DOOM-based first person shooter 
by Raven Software.


ABOUT THIS VERSION
------------------
JHexen is no longer in a beta stage, but there still might be a bug or two
hiding somewhere in there. This version uses the Doomsday engine, an 
enhanced and generalized version of the legendary Doom engine.



REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Windows 95/98/NT
- (accelerated) OpenGL or Direct3D (DX6)
- DirectX 3 or newer (DirectX 6 for multiplayer games)
- Hexen 1.1



FEATURES
--------
- mouse look
- enhanced menus
    * keyboard, mouse and joystick configuration
    * graphics options
    * music device selection
    * multiplayer menu
- freely resizable status bar
- Quake-style console
- bug fixes from Hexen
    * timedemo
    * turning during demo recording
- dynamic lights (still a bit slow...)
- lens flares
- multiplayer games using DirectPlay
- 3D sounds and environmental effects (DirectSound3D, EAX and A3D)
- plus much more... (see the change log)



INSTALLATION
------------
Unzip the files in the package into a directory of your choosing, possibly the
one Hexen is in. You can start the game using one of the batch files or
directly with Doomsday.exe using the appropriate command-line options (-game
and -gl are the most important ones).

   NOTE: If you aren't installing in the Hexen directory, you'll have to use 
   the -file option to specify hexen.wad, or add hexen.wad to "default_wads" 
   in the configuration file. In the launcher, add the wad to the list of 
   external wads.

I recommend you create a Windows shortcut to DLaunch.exe and change its icon 
to the one included in the JHexen DLL. Alternatively you can start the game
using one of the batch files (JHexen.bat, for instance).



OPTIONS
-------
-a3d:           Enable A3D. Otherwise DirectSound is used.
-gl <dll>:      Specifies the renderer to use (drOpenGL.dll by default).
-nofullscreen:  Start the game in a window.
-width <num>:   Specify the dimensions of the game window/screen.
-height <num>
-bpp <num>:     Specify the color depth to use in the game.
-dump <name>:   Writes out the specified lump and quits.
-dumpwaddir:    Prints the names of all the lumps and quits.
-nosound:       Don't initialize sound or music.
-nosfx:         Don't initialize sound.
-nomusic:       Don't initialize music.
-novideo:       Don't initialize video.
-timedemo <dm>: Plays demo <dm> and measures the maximum FPS.
-outlines:      All letters, sprites, etc. will have black outlines.

Basically all the old Hexen options are working, for instance:

-skill <n>:     Set the difficulty level (1-5, 3=normal).
-deathmatch:    For deathmatch, otherwise co-op.
-nomonsters:    No monsters.
-randclass:     Random player class in deathmatch.
-class <n>:     Set the player class (0=fighter, 1=cleric, 2=mage).
-warp <n>:      Start in map <n>.

Options for the Direct3D renderer:

-driver <name>: Choose the driver to use, if several are available.
-texbits:       Texture color depth (16 or 32).
-zbits:         Z-buffer depth (16, 24 or 32).
-nodither:      Disable dithering.
-badtexalpha:   If possible, choose the texture format with less alpha bits.
-nogamma:       Disable hardware gamma.

Options for the OpenGL renderer:

-allowsoftware: Allow using the software renderer if there is no hardware 
                accelerated OpenGL.



TIPS
----
- Type 'help' in the console. 'listcmds' and 'listvars' will show you a list
  of the console commands and variables, respectively.

- Screenshots can be taken with the console command 'screenshot'. You could
  for example bind it to F12: 'bind f12 screenshot'.

- You can bind several keys or buttons to the same control/action in the 
  Controls menu. Rebind a key or button to remove a binding. Binding a 
  control or action to the tilde key (console activation) removes all the
  bindings for the control or action. Nothing can be bound to the Esc key,
  which is used for menu activation.

- By default, the desktop color depth is used in the game. 

- The current implementation of the dynamic lights is a bit slow when there
  are a lot of luminous objects to draw. The console variable 'dynlights'
  controls the rendering of the dynamic lights. Just set it to zero if things 
  slow down too much, like in the main hall of Heresiarch's Seminary (map 13).
  You can also use 'maxdl' to set the maximum number of dynamic lights. Notice
  that if you're using lens flares, many of the dynamic light calculations 
  must still be done...

- If the screen borders flicker when sizing down the view, you have two
  options: 1) don't size down the view or 2) set the 'borderupd' console
  variable to 1 (also in the Graphics menu). This can happen especially with 
  the D3D renderer.



KNOWN BUGS & OTHER ISSUES
-------------------------
- The D3D renderer doesn't yet support display mode changes, so you'll have
  to restart the game if you want to change the resolution when using it.

- Small gaps between polygons can be noticeable in certain maps (e.g. map08).

- Due to inaccuracies in the original map data, it is possible to encounter
  quite large holes in the walls, floors and ceilings. Use glBSP to get rid of
  them (http://www.netspace.net.au/~ajapted/glbsp.html).

- Sprites are two-dimensional so they look flat when viewed from up or down
  at a steep angle. See the console variables spralign and r_maxSpriteAngle.

- Multiplayer games work in Windows NT if you have DirectPlay 6.
