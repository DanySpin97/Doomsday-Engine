BETA RELEASE
This is a non-optimized debug build. Single player games should work
flawlessly but there are many things that are still wrong with network
games. No 3D models have been included.

Since this is a beta version, I'd appreciate hearing how it works for you.
Especially interesting are all problems with single player games. If you
encounter any, please send me an email with the contents of Doomsday.out
included.

To play, run Kicks.exe.


KNOWN BUGS

- Loading a savegame during netplay doesn't work. Depending on the
circumstances you might end up with strange warping effects, an AssertLinks
error or a crash.

- The data of sectors is sent to clients only when they are close enough.
Currently the range is too short, and clients will sometimes notice doors
opening abruptly etc. when they approach them.

- Earthquakes don't happen on the client.

- Recording of demos during netplay might not work at all.
