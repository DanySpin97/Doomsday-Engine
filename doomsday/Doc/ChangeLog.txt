                        ==========================
               Legend: + added, - fixed, * improved/changed


Version 1.7.9 (work in progress)
-------------
* low-level networking updated to DirectX 8
* improved network setup GUI
+ netgame server info includes: game mode (e.g. doom1-ultimate, 
  doom2-plut, hexen), game config, IWAD, PWADs, player names
* client can only connect to servers in the same game mode
* cmd 'net' prints usage info
* cvar 'net-ip-port' is the local TCP/IP port
* "Filter mouse movement" added to Control Panel's Input page
* -nohightex now only affects wall textures and flats
* crosshair color alpha (cmd "crosshair color", var "view-cross-a")
+ info about network setup added to cphelp.txt, shows up during setup
+ cvar 'server-player-limit': maximum number of clients
+ cvar 'rend-light-wall-angle': intensity of angle-based wall lighting
+ cvar 'input-mouse-filter': average mouse X/Y axis values
+ model flag 'df_dim' (0x1000000): model is never rendered fullbright
+ cmds 'movefloor', 'moveceil', 'movesec': move a sector's plane(s)
- fixed: client was able to connect to a server running a different game
- fixed: aborted client connection crashed the server
- potential problem handling client connections fixed
- DirectSound 8: fixed a problem with buffer loading; using -csd should 
  no longer be necessary
- Sound definition patching fixed (Ext/Group keys were ignored)

KickStart:
* Cheb's KickStart v2.09 replaces the ancient v1.6

jDoom:
+ automap added to Options -> Controls (under Misc.)
+ cvar game-corpse-sliding: corpses slide down stairs and ledges 
  (defaults to zero due to some bad behaviour; e.g. exit room of D2/22)
* cvar game-corpsetime renamed to game-corpse-time
- A_Tracer() used to spawn puffs that were identical to bullet puffs, 
  this caused complications with particle generators

jHexen:
- fixed: sound sequence delays with repeating sounds (sequence updater
  didn't get correct information about currently playing sound effects)


Version 1.7.8
-------------
+ new master server mechanism (uses HTTP)
+ cvar net-master-path (default: "/master.php"): location of the master
  server at 'net-master-address' (default: "www.doomsdayhq.com")
+ cmd "net announce": send a server announcement to the master (if 
  server-public is nonzero, announcements are made automatically at two
  minute intervals)
* cvar net-master-port (default: 0): usually zero or 80
* clientside player coords override serverside coords under normal
  circumstances (maxdif checks removed)
* if one part of a psprite is fullbright, the whole psprite will be
- fixed: psprites were rendered with depth testing enabled; Doom plasma 
  rifle fire anim was broken
- fixed: clientside player animation didn't finish anim sequence
- fixed: line flags weren't updated on clientside (e.g. in Hexen map13)
- fixed: minor edge artifact with multipart psprites (e.g. in jDoom)

jDoom:
* lineattack weapons hit planes (pistol, shotguns, chaingun) 
- fixed: lineattack check for hitting sky planes, skyhack walls
- map31 and map32 no longer assumed to exist: Doom2.wad "00f6d407" 
  should work 
- weapon psprite timings (in Objects.ded) adjusted for super shotgun,
  rocket launcher: muzzle flash was out-of-sync by 1-2 tics

jHexen:
- fixed: dedicated server tried to draw teleport gfx and crashed
- fixed: scripted + yellow messages not shown on clientside
- fixed: client crashes when changing level
- fixed: status bar flicker

jtNet2:
- old master server stuff removed


Version 1.7.7
-------------
+ switch texture pairs (SW1/SW2) are precached at the same time
+ "Generator:Stage:Radius rnd": Randomness of particle radius
+ sound-info shows sound names as well as ID numbers
+ support for textured particles
* flat particles stick to planes
- high-resolution flats with 4 channels (alpha) were loaded incorrectly
- sector lightlevel overflow in sectordelta (e.g. on jHexen map 26)
- alternative texture path must be tried first when loading hires images
  (-texdir2)

jDoom:
* cvar player-air-movement: player movement speed while airborne 
  (0-32); use only small values in netgames
  
jHeretic:
- blinking statbar borders fixed
