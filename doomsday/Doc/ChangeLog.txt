                        Doomsday Engine Change Log
                        ==========================
               Legend: + added, - fixed, * improved/changed


Version 1.7.12 (work in progress)
--------------
+ option -leaveramp: don't reset color settings back to previous values
  at shutdown
* music data will not be cached into the memory zone while loading 
  (large MP3s wasted a lot of space) 
* 'InFine' is an alternative name for the 'Finale' definition
- removed obsolete settings from Control Panel: Network
- removed detail texture maximum distance cvar and Control Panel slider
- removed cvars 'rend-light-clip', 'rend-light-shrink'
- fixed: possible crash in Con_Error()

Refresh:
+ texture/flat animation sequences defined using Group defs (Anim.ded)
+ "tgf_smooth": interpolate between steps in texture/flat animation
+ particle generator flag "gnf_group": triggered by all in the flat's
  animation group
* texture/flat groups can be used purely for precaching
* detail texture contrast is preprocessed: there will be multiple 
  instances of the same texture with different contrast levels (needs
  a bit more memory but allows faster rendering)
* PCX images aren't loaded redundantly from virtual files  
- fixed: particles sliding over ledges
- fixed: Generator Center angle (Y) offset was ignored with mobj sources

Renderer:
+ model blending modes: subtract and reverse subtract
* renderer uses multitexturing for detail textures, dynamic lights,
  interpolated texture animation and model shiny skins
* shiny skins are correctly masked by alpha in main skin
* if multitexturing is available, masked walls will get one dynamic 
  light (previously masked walls were not lit by dynlights)
* dynamic light polygons are no longer clipped
* calculations to determine surfaces affected by a dynamic light are
  more accurate (light has a better chance to be visible)
- removed option -maxor: clipper has now unlimited nodes
- fixed: leaking lights (impossible route detection)
- fixed: stray pixels along polygon edges in dynamically lit areas
- fixed: detail texture blending when fog is enabled
- fixed: object shadows weren't affected by fog
- fixed: skymask holes in skyfixed sectors
- fixed: console text gibberish on the first time the console is drawn

drOpenGL:
+ support for multitexturing
+ NV_texture_env_combine4 or ATI_texture_env_combine3 required when 
  rendering dynamic lights with multitexturing
+ support for SGIS_generate_mipmap
+ support for EXT_blend_subtract
- removed -vtxar option (arrays are used always)

jDoom:
+ crosshair alpha slider added to the HUD menu
* titlescreen sequence defined as an InFine script (ID = "title")
- fixed: intermissions/finales in Plut/TNT

jHeretic:
* player mobj selector is set to match currently used weapon
* titlescreen sequence defined as an InFine script (ID = "title")

jHexen:
* player mobj selector is set to match currently used weapon
* titlescreen sequence defined as an InFine script (ID = "title")

InFine:
+ cmd 'startinf (scriptid)' (and 'stopinf')
+ gradient rectangles
+ object rotation (pics, text objects, rectangles)
+ command "ScaleXY (handle) (x) (y)"
+ command "Rect (handle) (x) (y) (w) (h)"
+ command "FillColor (h) (TOP/BOTTOM/BOTH) (r) (g) (b) (a)"
+ command "EdgeColor (h) (TOP/BOTTOM/BOTH) (r) (g) (b) (a)"
+ condition "MODE:(game-mode)"
+ command "ELSE"
+ command "DO" ... ";" (nestable blocks)
+ command "PlayDemo (filename)"
+ command "Cmd (console command)"
+ command "OnKey (key-ident) (marker)": jump to marker when key pressed
+ command "UnsetKey (key-ident)"
+ commands "Events", "NoEvents": enable/disable interactive mode
+ commands "Trigger", "NoTrigger": enable/disable menu triggering mode
* generic object commands: "Del", "X", "Y", "Sx", "Sy", "Scale", "Angle"
  "ScaleXY", "RGB", "Alpha"
* old pic/text commands that should no longer be used: "DelPic", 
  "DelText", "TextRGB", "TextAlpha", "Tx", "Ty", "TSx", "TSy", 
  "TextScale"
* InFine can run in overlay mode (e.g. during GS_LEVEL)
* InFine states are nested (script -> demo -> script -> demo -> etc.)
- fixed: "WaitText" timing with \w, \W, \p, \P
- fixed: "SoundAt" volume


Version 1.7.11
--------------
! Bugfixes Only
* revised server delta generation: fixed-size frames, prioritized 
  contents, sounds are stored inside frames (not separate packets),
  redundant missile coordinates not sent
* server refuses connection if new client's ID already in use
* revised clientside handling of frames: collision detection for 
  movement prediction, missiles hidden on impact
* revised low-level networking: implement confirmed/ordered packets 
  manually, detect duplicates, Huffman encoding (60%-70% compression)
+ cmd 'huffman': print Huffman efficiency and number of bytes sent
* mobj translucency 0-255 (selector still overrides)
* mobj floatbobbing is done by engine (clientside), DDMF_BOB added
* client is allowed some movement while airborne (easier jumping)
* by default, external resources are no longer loaded for textures from
  PWADs; use the -pwadtex option to change this 
  (cvar 'rend-tex-external-always')
* console command line cursor can be moved left and right
* default key repeat interval is now 3 tics (was 4)
* braces { and } are equivalent to quotes, e.g.:
  "alias init-map03 {after 1 {warp 5}}"
* cmd 'listcmds' prints a description for each command
+ cmd 'toggle': toggle a cvar's value between zero and nonzero
+ cmd 'if': execute a command if the condition is true (tests cvar 
  values)
* max number of light decorations increased to 16 per texture
- fixed: occlusion for planes exactly at eye-Z

  files (-file, load; no unload, though), contents added to the virtual
  file hierarchy (package root dir => Doomsday base dir)
+ after runtime directory has been searched, data files are also 
  searched from the default data directory (e.g. Data\jDoom\):
  "-file Test.wad" will load Data\jDoom\Test.wad
+ WAD, LMP, PK3 and ZIP files from the Data\Game\Auto directory are

  server-public is nonzero, announcements are made automatically at two
  minute intervals)
* cvar net-master-port (default: 0): usually zero or 80
* clientside player coords override serverside coords under normal
  circumstances (maxdif checks removed)
* if one part of a psprite is fullbright, the whole psprite will be
- fixed: psprites were rendered with depth testing enabled; Doom plasma 
  rifle fire anim was broken
- fixed: clientside player animation didn't finish anim sequence
