/**
 * Utility for managing and drawing semi-static GL buffers.
 *
 * The main purpose of GLDrawQueue is to minimize the number of draw calls needed for
 * drawing the view.
 *
 * GLDrawQueue owns a large GLBuffer from which smaller segments can be assigned out to
 * users. The segments may be changed at any time without affecting the rest of the
 * buffer's contents. If the GLBuffer runs out of space, a larger one will be allocated.
 *
 * GLDrawQueue also owns a GLProgram whose shaders must support collecting uniform values
 * from each queued draw into arrays (element indices are stored as vertex attributes).
 * If the arrays get full, the queue is automatically flushed.
 *
 * GLDrawQueue also has a GLState that is used for drawing the queued geometry. If the
 * state is changed, all previously queued data is first flushed. For example, changing
 * the clip rectangle always causes a flush.
 *
 * Internally, GLDrawQueue uses Drawable to manage its GL objects.
