/**
 * Info document tree with a script context and built-in support for handling
 * expressions and embedded scripts.
 *
 * Analogous to an XML document with embedded JavaScript: Info acts as the
 * generic, declarative, structured document and Doomsday Script is the
 * procedural programming language.
 *
 * An instance of ScriptedInfo contains an Info document. It has its own
 * private script execution context, in which expressions can be evaluated and
 * scripts run. After a ScriptedInfo has been parsed, all the embedded scripts
 * are run and the Info elements become variables and values in the local
 * namespace (ScriptedInfo::names()).
 *
 * @par Grouping
 *
 * The block type "group" is reserved for generic grouping of contained
 * elements. If the group is named, it will contribute its name to the path
 * of the produced variable (same as with any named block):
 * <pre>group test {
 *     type1 block { key = value }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In this example, the variable representing @c key would be
 * <tt>test.block.key</tt> in the ScriptedInfo instance's namespace.
 *
 * @par Special elements
 *
 * Each block of a ScriptedInfo document has a couple of special elements
 * that alter how the block is processed:
 *
 * - The "condition" element that may be present in any block determines
 *   whether the block is processed or skipped. The value of the "condition"
 *   element is evaluated as a script, and if it evaluates to False, the
 *   entire block is ignored.
 *
 * - The contents of any previously processed block (or any record available in
 *   the namespace) can be copied with the special inheritance element
 *   (named "inherits"):
 * <pre>type1 firstblock { key = value }
 * type2 exampleblock inherits firstblock {}</pre>
 *
 *   Here @c firstblock would be treated as a variable name in the document's
 *   local namespace, referring to the block above, which has already been
 *   added to the local namespace (elements are processed sequentially from
 *   beginning to end). The resulting Record is:
 * <pre>exampleblock. __inherit__: firstblock
 *                  __type__: type2
 *                       key: value
 *   firstblock. __type__: type1
 *                    key: value</pre>
 *
 * @par Group inheritance
 *
 * When the "inherits" element is used in a group, it will affect all the
 * blocks in the group instead of inheriting anything into the group itself.
 * <pre>thing A { key = value }
 * group {
 *     inherits = A
 *     thing B {}
 *     thing C {}
 * }</pre>
 * Here B and C would both inherit from A.
