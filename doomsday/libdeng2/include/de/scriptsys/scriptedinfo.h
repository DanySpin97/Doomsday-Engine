/**
 * Info document tree with a script context and built-in support for handling
 * expressions and embedded scripts.
 *
 * Analogous to an HTML document with embedded JavaScript: Info acts as the
 * declarative, structured document and Doomsday Script is the procedural
 * programming language.
 *
 * An instance of ScriptedInfo represents an Info document. It has its own
 * private script execution context, in which expressions can be evaluated and
 * scripts run. After a ScriptedInfo has been parsed, all the embedded scripts
 * are run and the Info elements become variables and values in the local
 * namespace.
 *
 * Each block of a ScriptedInfo document has a couple of special elements
 * that alter how the block is processed:
 *
 * - The "condition" element that may be present in any block determines
 *   whether the block is processed or skipped. The value of the "condition"
 *   element is evaluated as a script, and if it evaluates to False, the
 *   entire block is ignored.
 *
 * - The contents of any previously processed block (or any record available in
 *   the namespace) can be copied with the special inheritance element
 *   (named ":"):
 * <pre>type1 first-block { key = value }
 * type2 example-block : first-block {}</pre>
 *
 *   Here @c first-block would be treated as a variable name in the document's
 *   local namespace, referring to the block above, which has already been
 *   added to the local namespace (elements are processed sequentially from
 *   beginning to end).
