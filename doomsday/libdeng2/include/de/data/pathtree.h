     * Data structure for modelling a hierarchical relationship tree of
     * Path + data value pairs.
     *
     * @em Segment is the term given to a components of a hierarchical path.
     * For example, the path <pre>"c:/somewhere/something"</pre> contains three
     * path segments: <pre>[ 0: "c:", 1: "somewhere", 2: "something" ]</pre>
     *
     * @em Delimiter is the term given to the separators between segments.
     * (Such as forward slashes in an UNIX-style file path).
     *
     * Internally, segments are "pooled" such that only one instance of a
     * segment is included in the model of the whole tree. Potentially, this
     * significantly reduces the memory overhead which would otherwise be
     * necessary to represent the complete hierarchy as a set of fully composed
     * paths.
     *
     * Delimiters are not included in the hierarchy model. Not including the
     * delimiters allows for optimal dynamic replacement when recomposing the
     * original paths (also reducing the memory overhead for the whole data
     * set). One potential use for this feature when representing file path
     * hierarchies is "ambidextrously" recomposing paths with either forward or
     * backward slashes, irrespective of the delimiter used at path insertion
     * time.
     *
     * Somewhat similar to a Prefix Tree (Trie) representationally although
     * that is where the similarity ends.
