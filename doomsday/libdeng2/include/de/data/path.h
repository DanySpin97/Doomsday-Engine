/**
 * A textual path composed of segments. @ingroup data
 *
 * A path is a case insensitive text string that is broken down into segments.
 * Path is a generic class and as such does not provide any interpretation of
 * what the path refers to; it just parses the string and splits it into
 * segments. The user may choose any character to act as the segment separator.
 *
 * Paths are used when identifying and organizing structured data. One
 * practical example is file system paths.
 *
 * Internally, the class avoids duplicating the provided path String (i.e.,
 * string is not altered), instead relying on the implicit sharing of QString.
