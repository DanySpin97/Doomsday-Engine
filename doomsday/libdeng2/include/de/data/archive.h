     * Collection of named memory blocks stored inside a byte array.
     *
     * An archive consists of a collection of Block instances that are
     * identified using a path tree structure. Blocks can be added and removed
     * at any time.
     *
     * Archive is merely IWritable instead of ISerializable because of its
     * memory management model. The basic assumption is that even though the
     * archive is kept in serialized form, individual entries can still be
     * accessed without processing the entire serialization. Therefore, Archive
     * only operates on existing, serialized archives that live in externally
     * owned byte arrays; Archive does not take ownership of the source data.
     * This also means that read-only access to very large byte arrays can be
     * done without loading all the source data into memory (e.g., Archive
     * that reads from a large NativeFile).
     *
     * It is also assumed that accessing the source data and extracting a
     * particular entry is potentially a slow operation: when individual
     * entries are read from the source, the entries are cached in memory so
     * that subsequent access is fast.
     *
     * An Archive instance expects that the source byte array is never changed
     * by third parties while it is the source of the Archive.
     *
     * It is possible to detach an Archive instance from its source byte array
     * by calling cache(DetachFromSource). This forces all entries to be copied
     * to Archive-owned memory (in original serialized form).
