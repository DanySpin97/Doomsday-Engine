/** 
 * compare_float.cpp: Floating Point Approximate Comparison Routines.
 * These rely on the IEEE floating point representation which is true
 * on x86 and amd64 hardware but may not be on others.
 *
 * Due to all floating point numbers being approximate, we can't
 * actually compare them like integers, often the least significant
 * bits are different as a result of truncations involved in
 * approximating the numbers, so while mathematically we would check
 * for equality, practically, we should check to see we are close
 * enough, and are within our allowed margin of error.
 *
 * For an easy example of how the same floating point equations
 * can produce different results, do the same equation using the SSE
 * unit, and the x87 units of modern x86 or amd64 systems, and compare.
 * You'll find they don't match - the x87 contains a higher internal
 * accuracy although the both comply with the IEEE standards.
 *
 * Based on the very clever paper by Bruce Dawson located at
 * http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm
