/**
 * High-level GL text drawing utility.
 *
 * The task of drawing text is rather complicated. There are several components
 * involved:
 *
 * - de::EscapeParser parses style escape codes.
 * - de::Font understands rich text formatting and performs the actual
 *   rasterization of text onto bitmap images.
 * - FontLineWrapping takes rich-formatted ("styled") text and wraps it onto
 *   multiple lines, taking into account tab stops and indentation.
 * - GLTextComposer allocates the text lines from an Atlas and generates the
 *   triangle strips needed for actually drawing the text on the screen.
 *
 * TextDrawable is a high-level utility for controlling this entire process as
 * easily as possible. If fine-grained control of the text is required, one can
 * still use the lower level components directly.
 *
 * TextDrawable handles wrapping of text using a background thread, so content
 * length is unlimited and the calling thread will not block. TextDrawable is
 * an Asset, and will not be marked ready until the background wrapping is
 * done. One is still required to call TextDrawable::update() before drawing,
 * though.
