/**
 * Widget showing a label text and/or image.
 *
 * LabelWidget offers several parameters for controlling the layout of the text
 * and image components. The widget is also able to independently determine its
 * size to exactly fit its contents (according to the LabelWidget::SizePolicy).
 *
 * The alignment parameters are applied as follows:
 *
 * - LabelWidget::setAlignment() defines where the content of the widget is
 *   aligned as a group, once the relative positions of the image and the text
 *   have been determined.
 *
 * - LabelWidget::setTextAlignment() defines where the text will be positioned
 *   in relation to the image. For instance, if the text alignment is AlignRight,
 *   the text will be placed on the right side of the image. If there is no
 *   image, this has no effect.
 *
 * - LabelWidget::setImageAlignment() defines how the image is aligned in
 *   relation to text when both are visible. For instance, if text is aligned to
 *   AlignRight (appearing on the right side of the image), then an image
 *   alignment of AlignTop would align the top of the image with the top of the
 *   text. AlignBottom would align the bottom of the image with the bottom of the
 *   text. This value must be on the perpendicular axis when compared to text
 *   alignment (otherwise it has no effect).
 *
 * - LabelWidget::setTextLineAlignment() defines the alignment of each individual
 *   wrapped line of text within the text block.
 *
 * Additionally, LabelWidget::setImageFit() defines how the image will be
 * scaled inside the area reserved for the image.
