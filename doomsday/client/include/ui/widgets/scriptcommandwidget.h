/**
 * Interactive Doomsday Script command line.
 *
 * The widget has its own script Process in which all commands gets executed.
 * The namespace of this process persists across entered commands (but not
 * across engine shutdown).
 *
 * An entered command is not accepted until it parses successfully as a
 * Doomsday Script statement. In other words, it is possible to enter
 * multi-line scripts when there are open braces etc. If there is a true syntax
 * error in the entered script, a popup will open showing the exception from
 * the parser.
