/**
 * Popup dialog.
 *
 * The content area of a dialog is scrollable. A menu with buttons is placed in
 * the bottom of the dialog, for the actions available to the user.
 *
 * The contents of the dialog should be placed under the scroll area returned
 * by DialogWidget::content() and positioned in relation to its content rule.
 * When the dialog is set up, one must define the size of the content scroll
 * area (width and height rules).
 *
 * Note that when a widget is added to the content area, the dialog
 * automatically applies certain common style parameters (margins, backgrounds,
 * etc.).
 *
 * @par Widget Structure
 *
 * Dialogs are composed of several child widgets:
 * <pre>
 * DialogWidget    (PopupWidget)
 *  +- container   (GuiWidget; the popup content widget)
 *      +- heading (LabelWidget; optional)
 *      +- area    (ScrollAreaWidget; contains actual dialog widgets)
 *      +- buttons (MenuWidget)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Scrolling is set up so that the dialog height doesn't surpass the view
 * rectangle's height. Contents of the "area" widget scroll while the other
 * elements remain static in relation to the container.
