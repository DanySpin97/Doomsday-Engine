COMPILING DOOMSDAY AND THE LIBRARIES
====================================

This document describes the recommended way for building Doomsday and
the libraries on any system.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

You will need these tools and libraries for building everything:

- Cmake 2.4 or latter ( http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html )
- A C Compiler (GCC on *NIX, OSX. Cygwin, MingGW, Borland or Visual C on Windows)
- GNU Make on *NIX, Cygwin or MinGW
- ncurses on *NIX, OSX
- OpenGL (This can be disabled in cmake for a dedicated build)
- GLU (This can be disabled in cmake for a dedicated build)
- SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
- SDL_net
- SDL_mixer (This can be disabled in cmake for a dedicated build)
- OpenAL (This can be disabled in cmake for a dedicated build)
- zip (to create Doomsday.pk3) ( http://www.info-zip.org/ )


IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE TARBALL:
-----------------------------

1. Unpack the source tarball, if you haven't already done so.

2. Create your build directory.  It can be located anywhere, for 
   example under the doomsday directory in the source tree.  For 
   instance:
   
      $ mkdir deng-1.9.0/doomsday/mybuild
      $ cd deng-1.9.0/doomsday/mybuild

3. Run CMake.  For example:

      $ cmake ..

4. If cmake failed due to missing libraries, install the required
   ones.  Make sure you have the development files for each.

5. Compile everything:

      $ make

6. On *NIX run "su -c 'make install'" or "sudo 'make install'" 
   depending on you *NIX distribution.  This will install the 
   executable (doomsday), the libraries (games, renderer, sound), 
   data files and definitions files under the directory specified
   by the configured prefix.

7. See the main README for tips on running the game.


IF YOU USE SVN:
---------------

1. Check out a copy of the project files from the SourceForge SVN.
   You will only need the "doomsday" module.  You can find
   instructions on how to accomplish this here:

      http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=74815

2. Proceed to compiling as with a source tarball (from step 2).
