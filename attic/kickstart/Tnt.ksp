Story=Final Doom is the last in the Doom games. It was made not by id software but by \nTeamTNT who also made the Boom engine, an add-on made with the recently \nreleased source code. It contains two new 32 level doom2 wads called \n'Evilution' and 'The Plutonia Experiment', heaps of new music and some new \ntextures.
